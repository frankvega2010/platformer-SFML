## Introduction

Patient Zero is a game based on the concept of many 2D Shooters, you are thrown into a level and fight your way through the end of the level, while you collect points and get new weaponry. As a bonus, we may include new features!

As for now, the current features we want to add to the game are:

- At Least 2 levels.
- Tilemaps for the levels.
- Player's aim with mouse movement.
- 3 Weapons.
- Limited Ammunition.
- 2 Types of enemies.
- Music.
- Sound Effects.

## Bio (Franco Vega)

My name's Franco and I'm a game dev enthusiast who is currently studying Programming (and Game Design) so one day I can put all my effort and time in the videogames industry, which is constantly rising. I'm a beginner in Programming but I'm trying my best to make the best experiences possible as well as keeping the code nice and clean.
